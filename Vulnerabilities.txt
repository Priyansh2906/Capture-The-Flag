1) Auth Bypass - Change response code
2) API Rate limit - Make it like an attendance code layout That can fetch attendance records from db, overflow them like the vulnerability from the mdx app. 1000 records reveal the flag.
3) SQL Injection - Error based SQL Injection where database name is the flag
4) OS Command Injection
5) Jinja2 SSTI + RCE
6) Add an RCE where users get an exe to reverse engineer

7) Encryption Decryption in web apps, create a decryption function to perform an IDOR and get the flag
8) Create a challenge that asks the user to find the vulnerability and fix it, to reveal the flag
